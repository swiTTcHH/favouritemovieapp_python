## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Add movies to their database
- View movies in the database
- Search for movies within the database


## My process
During the course of this challenge, I had initially tried to do it using OOP and python classes. However, that proved rather futile and almost impossible. I came to the conclusion that I was either not skilled enough to use OOP or python classes to perform the functionality I required or it was just an impossible thing. Either way, I decided to use regular python functions which I defined and implemented the functionality I wanted.

### Built with

- Python
- Python functions

### What I learned

- Python functions
Declaring functions and calling them
```
def func_name(optional_func_parameter):
    funtion
```
### Useful resources

- Kalob Taulien's Fullstack web developer's course(https://www.udemy.com/share/101Wlg3@0WIU2rnDje7PEFpzf7lhVHlDgl6pVTutTSRFZlW0S0sDFnS7zIvWfFWL7_xnlixRqg==/) - a useful udemy course I've been using to learn everything web development. It might be a bit outdated but still very useful
